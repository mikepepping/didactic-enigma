Making a golang networked something, I dont know what, I'm just vibing it out

## Goal

I didnt know what to make when I first created this repo.
Currently working towards a multi user Conways game of life.

## Milestones
- [x] Basic running version of conways
- [ ] TCP wrapper
    - [ ] allow for clients to set cells to be alive
    - [ ] allow for clients to request a copy of the current state (flawed approach but intermediate milestone)
- [ ] Create a basic client that can:
    - [ ] set cells to be alive
    - [ ] fetch and render the current state of the grid from the server periodically
